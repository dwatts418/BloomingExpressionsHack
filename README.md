# BloomingExpressionsHack
<p>For Mother’s Day this year I wanted to do something special, something other than just buying a gift; I wanted to make something unique.  While shopping for a Mother’s Day card I saw the Hallmark Blooming Expressions display.  I thought the small animated flower was interesting; however, given that you have to press a button each time you want the flower to open or close, I thought it would loose its novelty after a short time.</p>
